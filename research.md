I'm currently working on machine learning projects in neuroscience with Professor [Sahand Rahi](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lpbs/professor-rahi/) and in economics with Professor [Peter Egger](https://mtec.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MTY2NTM0.TGlzdC8yODk2LC0yMDgyMjgwMDQ4.html). Various other projects I've worked on are listed below, organized by application area. My PhD dissertation may be found [here](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/46581/Jones_washington_0250E_22188.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).

### Statistical machine learning for any domain
Recently many papers have focused on achieving the best possible performance in a common domain-specific semi-supervised learning task. In this work we instead introduce approaches to end-to-end learning that allow one to jointly learn feature representations from unlabeled data (with or without labeled data) and learn the labels in a domain-agnostic manner. The proposed approaches can be used on any amount of labeled and unlabeled data, gracefully adjusting to the amount of supervision.

### Statistical machine learning for computer vision
ConvNets are typically viewed as different in essence from kernel-based methods. In this work we show that this is unfounded, both formally and empirically. After providing a systematic framework to translate between ConvNets and convolutional kernel networks (CKNs), we demonstrate that ConvNets and their translations into their more principled counterparts, CKNs, perform similarly on landmark computer vision tasks.

### Statistical machine learning for marine ecology
Oceanographers at the University of Washington are studying phytoplankton, organisms that are responsible for 50% of the total photosynthesis on Earth. We developed a change-point algorithm that may one day be embedded on board their research vessels to help them adapt their models and data collection in real time. The algorithm will also be used in retrospective analyses. Our work was featured on the UW eScience [website](http://escience.washington.edu/shifts-in-marine-microbial-populations-detected-using-statistical-machine-learning/).

### Statistical analysis of meteorological models
The effects of a weather model's parameters on the model's forecasts are not well-understood. In this work we performed a sensitivity analysis of the parameters of the COAMPS weather model on the spatial structure of its forecasts. Ideally, we would eventually be able to tune the parameters to improve forecasts.

### Statistical machine learning for healthcare
Sequences of medial billing codes for millions of patients contain a wealth of information about diseases and people's behaviors. After demonstrating that [canonical correlation analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_correlation) (CCA) discovers interesting relationships between codes, we explore the effectiveness of using CCA features in predicting elective surgery for diverticulitis.

### Machine learning for cyber security
The [STUCCO](https://stucco.github.io/) project at Oak Ridge National Lab aims to synthesize data from a variety of sources to help security analysts quickly learn about potential flaws in their systems.

### Economic analysis of international trade
My undergraduate thesis examined the factors that contribute to the extent of [exchange rate pass-through](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-rate_pass-through) for goods exported by Chinese firms. My advisor was [Kala Krishna](https://sites.google.com/site/kalakrishnapsu/).
