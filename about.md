I grew up in State College, Pennsylvania and attended Penn State University. After graduating in 2014 with bachelor's degrees in math, economics, and statistics, in addition to a master's in economics, I moved to Seattle for graduate school. I graduated in 2020 with a PhD in Statistics from the University of Washington.

In my free time I enjoy playing tennis.
